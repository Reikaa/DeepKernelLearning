# DeepKernelLearning

I have my faith on a combination between Deep Learning and Gaussian Processses. Deep Learning is great but it can be also improved by integrating model uncertainty (i.e. it will know when it works well and when it does not by doing so). 

A combination of deep learning and Gaussian Processes for *regression* is somewhat straightforward (well it is not that straightforward at all, but at least there are some code for it). But meanwhile it is not easy to find a code that works well for *classification*.

I found this peace of code useful, and plan to use it as a basic block to do my research in future. https://gist.github.com/john-bradshaw/11bbf17dbca013d9fc3886a7bfe46840

Note: It should run with TF 1.4, GPflow git commit f618fe4d9aa096b32a3d24576d68f46a3f260116
